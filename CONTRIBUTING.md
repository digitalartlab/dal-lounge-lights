# Contributing

Thank you for wanting to contribute to this project! We love open source projects and are very excited to now be doing our small bit for the community too.

Please take a moment to review our contributing guidelines, so this becomes a smooth process for both you and us.

## Code of Conduct
At Digital Art Lab we work hard to make everyone feel welcome and included, both online and offline. That's why we have a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). We expect everyone (that includes us) to stick to this code and treat each other respectfully.

## :sparkles: Submitting new animations or updating existing ones
**These LED strips are yours to play with too!** Feel free to tweak an existing animation or add a brand new one. Once you're ready to see it in action, just create a pull request, so we can deploy it to the live strips!

When creating your pull request, please keep the following in mind:
- Keep pull requests focussed on a single creation or issue

Do you want to do a larger refactor? Please start by opening an issue, so we're aware of your plans and can see if it fits with our goals. We wouldn't want you to spend a lot of time on something we can't merge into the live version... ðŸ˜¢

## Reporting issues
Include the following information in your post:
- Describe what you expected to happen.
- If possible, include a [minimal reproducible example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example) to help us
    identify the issue. This also helps check that the issue is not with your own code.
- Describe what actually happened. Include the full traceback if there was an exception.

## Support questions
Please don't use our issue tracker for general Fadecandy or Balena support questions, only for questions related to our specific implementation.

## Missing something here?
You can always contact us at info@digitalartlab.nl, or you can open an issue or pull request on this repository.
